## 🧠 Overview

This project analyzes IMDb and film location data to uncover patterns behind critically acclaimed movies — with a special focus on films shot in **San Francisco**.  

Inspired by a creative scenario featuring *Dr. Gru*, this analysis demonstrates my ability to query large datasets, extract insights, and communicate findings effectively using a combination of **SQL**, **Python**, and **data visualization**.

## 🎯 Key Questions

1. **Genre Success:**  
   *Among all films shot in San Francisco, which genres achieved the highest public acclaim, and which are the safest to shoot in?*

2. **Star Power Effect:**  
   *By how much do A-list actors over the past 30 years raise or lower average movie ratings?*

3. **Location Profitability:**  
   *Which San Francisco landmarks offer the greatest potential for cinematic and economic success?*

## 🔍 Approach

- Queried large IMDb datasets using **Google BigQuery** within a Jupyter Notebook environment.  
- Applied **SQL joins, filters, and aggregations** to merge movie metadata with filming locations.  
- Used **pandas** for data wrangling and **matplotlib / seaborn** for visual exploration.  
- Derived insights through trend analysis, outlier detection, and visualization of rating distributions.

## 📊 Results Highlights

- Certain **drama and action** genres consistently outperform others in public ratings when filmed in San Francisco.  
- **A-list actors** increase average ratings by a measurable margin — confirming the tangible “star power” effect.  
- Some iconic locations (e.g., Golden Gate Bridge) appear disproportionately in high-rated films, signaling strong brand association and tourism potential.
